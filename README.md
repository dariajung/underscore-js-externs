underscore-js-externs
=====================

This file provides externs for the Underscore js library, version 1.3.3,
for use with Google's Closure Compiler.

It covers both object-style notation (_.detect(array, function())), as
well as functional style (_(array).detect(function() {})).

Bug reports, pull requests are welcome.
